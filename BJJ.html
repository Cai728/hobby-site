                Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu (BJJ) is a martial art and combat sport that originated in Brazil, developed from Japanese Judo and Jiu-Jitsu. 
                It emphasizes ground fighting and submission holds, making it distinct from many other martial arts.
                </p>
    
              <p class="pb-6">BJJ places a strong emphasis on leverage and technique, allowing a smaller, weaker person to successfully defend against a 
                larger opponent. The philosophy centers around the concept that a fight can be taken to the ground, where size and strength matter less, 
                and skill and strategy become paramount.
                </p>
    
              <p class="pb-6">The core of BJJ involves ground fighting techniques, including positional control, escapes, sweeps, and submissions. 
                Practitioners learn to manipulate an opponent's body through joint locks and chokeholds, seeking dominant positions to control and 
                submit their adversary.
                </p>
    
              <div class="border-l-4 border-gray-500 pl-4 mb-6 italic rounded">
                Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu traces its roots to the early 20th century when Japanese Judo and Jiu-Jitsu were introduced to Brazil by Mitsuyo Maeda, 
                a judoka. The Gracie family, particularly Helio Gracie, adapted and refined these martial arts, emphasizing ground fighting and submissions to 
                create what is now known as BJJ. The art gained prominence in the 20th century as the Gracie family showcased its effectiveness in challenge matches and later established the first Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu academy. 
              </div>
    
              <p class="pb-6">While BJJ is a sport with a strong focus on competition, it also has practical self-defense applications. The emphasis on ground fighting and 
                submissions can be highly effective in real-world self-defense scenarios, where taking an opponent to the ground can neutralize threats.
                </p>
    
              <h2 class="text-2xl text-gray-800 font-semibold mb-4 mt-4">Why I like BJJ</h2>
    
              <p class="pb-6"> I only first started started BJJ in September, but in some ways it reminds of Chess, as it requires stratergy 
                and a game plan depending on the opponent's size, strength, and experience. This alongside with it being an physically cardio-heavy sport is great for someone like
                myself who dislikes other popular forms of cardio such as running or just any cardio in general. The BJJ community are also welcoming to all kinds of people, 
                and practitioners more experienced than myself are always available to give an helping hand.
