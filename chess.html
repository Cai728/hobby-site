                Chess is a classic two-player strategy board game believed to have originated in India around the 6th century. 
                Played on an 8x8 grid, each player starts with 16 pieces, including a king, queen, rooks, knights, bishops, and pawns. 
                The primary objective is to checkmate the opponent's king, rendering it unable to escape capture.
                </p>
    
              <p class="pb-6">The board setup consists of 64 squares arranged in an 8x8 grid, and players strategically position their pieces on this board. 
                The pieces, each with unique movements, include the king, queen, rook, bishop, knight, and pawn. The king moves one square in any direction, 
                while the queen can move diagonally, horizontally, or vertically any number of squares. Rooks move horizontally or vertically, bishops move 
                diagonally, and knights move in an "L" shape. Pawns move forward one square but capture diagonally, with an option for a two-square initial move.
                </p>
    
              <p class="pb-6">Special moves add complexity to the game, such as castling, a maneuver involving the king and rook, and en passant, a pawn capture 
                under specific conditions. Chess is played in distinct phases: the opening, where players develop their pieces; the middlegame, characterized by 
                strategic maneuvering; and the endgame, focusing on converting advantages into checkmate.
                </p>

                Chess has a rich and ancient history, with roots tracing back to India in the 6th century. The game initially known as "chaturanga" was played on 
                an 8x8 board and included pieces representing infantry, cavalry, elephants, and chariots, which evolved into the modern pawn, knight, bishop, and rook, respectively.
              </div>
    
              <p class="pb-6">Time control is often implemented in chess games, specifying the total time each player has for their moves. Draws can occur through 
                various mechanisms, including stalemate, threefold repetition, or insufficient material for checkmate. Chess notation, commonly algebraic, is used 
                to record moves systematically.

              <h2 class="text-2xl text-gray-800 font-semibold mb-4 mt-4">Why I like chess</h2>
    
              <p class="pb-6">Although I am more of an casual player of Chess, playing a few times a week on websites such as <a href="https://www.chess.com/home" class="text-blue-700"> chess.com</a>
                I first started playing back in 2020, my first year of University. This was when lockdown was in full force, and I was pretty much stuck in my student accomdation.
                I saw two of my friends playing Chess, intrigued, I asked to play, and found it enjoyable, especially in a time in which I was in perpetrated boredom.
                Over time I learnt some basic stratergies such as keeping controlling the centre of the board, forking, developing pieces. Admittedly, I play a lot less than
                I used to, but I still enjoy a game now and then.
